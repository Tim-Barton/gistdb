# gitst-db
My attempt to use gists as the simplest form of online database/datastore

## who should use this?
~~Anybody who is the same special brand of stupid I am~~
Anybody is looking for a datastore that is:
* simple to set up
* online
* free/cheap
* low volume
* only handling a single concurrent connection

## When should I use this
For the love of whatever diety you pray to **do not** use this in your production revenue generating systems

I'm writing this for use in a couple of personal projects where I don't want the data stuck on my laptop, but don't really care if the data goes caput
